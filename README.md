## Menu Features:

## IL Settings
### IL Mode:
This setting lets you practice & time individual level runs for most categories! [Click here to view the IL spreadsheet](https://www.docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLkc8-dGTO4jJhAi5nDrhm0h6qlVflPlAIlXAYEylsg/edit#gid=1140931951)

- Once you enter/re-fly in to a level, a timer will keep track of its time starting the first frame the HUD starts coming down from the fly in.
- Once you leave through a vortex/through the pause menu, it will then stop the first frame the HUD for the "RETURNING HOME" text starts coming down in the loading screen.
- The loading screen will then display your individual level time in big text, and underneath display the loadless version of the same time to account for dragons in slightly smaller text.
- It will also reload you back into the same level to let you practice on loop.
- This timer should be accurate within 1 frame (~0.03) in most situations.
	 
### IL Timer Display: 
This setting controls the main display setting for the IL Timer

- **IL TIMER DISPLAY AT END** mode displays the IL timer on screen only when you finish a level. This is to reduce minor lag that could be caused from the extra rendering of the text mobys.
- **TIMER ALWAYS** mode displays the IL timer on screen at all times, as well as at the end.    

### Display At Dragon: 
This setting will render the IL Timer when you freed a dragon.

### Display Landing: 
This setting will render the IL Timer when land on the ground.

### Loop Level: 
This setting controls if the level should loop upon exiting in IL Mode.

## Manual Timer Settings
### Manual Timer: 
This setting displays an on screen timer that resets upon reloading your state/reloading spyro, and stops upon pausing. Can be used for manually timing movement, routes, & tricks in game!

### Manual Timer Display Mode
- **DISPLAY ON STOPPED** mode displays the timer on screen only when you pause to stop the timer. This is to reduce minor lag that could be caused from the extra rendering of the text mobys.

When you turn it on you will notice 2 numbers in the bottom left, a numerator and denominator.

**Right Stick Down** - Manually decrease successful attempts  
**L2 + R2 + Right Stick Up** - Manually increase total attempts

 - [Bizhawk](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk) for searching/poking PS1 ram values easily
 - [PCSX-Redux](https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux/) for hot-reloading mods in for quick testing. Also for its debugging features.

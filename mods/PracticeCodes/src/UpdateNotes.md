# Changes:  

## IL Timer Display Settings
Landing timer has been renamed to **Display Settings**, and you can now display your time during multiple conditions:
- Landing
- Flaming
- Gliding
- Collecting a gem
- Collecting a flight level object
- Entering a whirlwind
- Bonking 
- Always 

It will also update the displayed time immediately, even if the previous displayed time has yet to expire.

*(IL time will **always** display at the end if IL mode is on)*

## IL Mode Disables Cheats
When you have IL Mode enabled, you will no longer have access to moonjump, perma sparx, and give key.

## Homeworld Fly-in Loop Option
When you level select into a homeworld, you will now have the option to disable/enable loop level during the load.
Just a small quality of life feature incase you forgot to turn off loop level before doing a homeworld RTA.

## Homeworld Balloonist Dialouge Options
When you talk to a balloonist at the end of a homeworld, it will always display the **success** dialouge you'd see in a run.

## CSGO
When doing credits skip, if you hold the start button as spyro is dying you will game over to allow for more accurate Gnorc Gnexus Homeworld RTA's.

# Bug Fixes
- Save states now save particles for particle based object conditions (Wizard Peak enemy spawning, Haunted Towers armor waking up)
- Fixed buggy flight level movement after instant fly in. 
- Fixed instability when loading a state with a timer on screen at the same time.
- Fixed instability when exiting Gnasty Gnorc with IL time on screen
- Fixed key glitch when loading a state. (Was already fixed for fly-in)
- Flight time will be saved as part of savestate
- Flights will be put back into uncompleted state when flying into a homeworld.

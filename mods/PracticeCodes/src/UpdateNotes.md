# Changes:  

## Misc Timer
Landing timer has been renamed to **misc timer**, and now display's your time during multiple conditions:
- Landing
- Flaming
- Gliding
- Collecting a gem
- Collecting a flight level object
- Entering a whirlwind
- Bonking  

It also will update the displayed time immediately, even if the previous displayed time has yet to expire.

## Homeworld Fly-in Loop Option
When you level select into a homeworld, you will now have the option to disable/enable loop level during the load.
Just a small quality of life feature incase you forgot to turn off loop level before doing a homeworld RTA.


# Bug Fixes
- Fixed buggy flight level movement after instant fly in. 
- Fixed instability when loading a state with a timer on screen at the same time.
- Fixed key glitch when loading a state. (Was already fixed for fly-in)
- Flight time will be saved as part of savestate
- Flights will be put back into their initial state when flying into a homeworld.

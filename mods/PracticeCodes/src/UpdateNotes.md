# New Features & Changes:

## Homeworld Gem Count
You can now change your gem count when level selecting into a homeworld.
Press L1 - Reduce Gemcount by 1
Press R1 - Increase Gemcount by 1
Press L2 - Reduce Gemcount by 10
Press R2 - Increase Gemcount by 10
Hold L2 - Decrease Gemcount Rapidly
Hold R2 - Increase Gemcount Rapidly

## Level Select Out of Level Portal
You can now level select out of any level portal. Choose a level in the level select (inventory), and hold down the triangle button during the fade to the fly in. Instead of going into the level, it will say returning home and you will come out of that level's portal.

## Change Fly-In Angle
You can now change the fly-in angle during the level select. Choose a level in the level select (inventory), and hold down the circle button during the fade to the fly in. The fly in angle will now be reversed.

## Fly In Reset Counter
You can now keep track of how many times you have attempted a level. The individual level dragon counts in the inventory menu have been replaced with the amount of times you have triggered the fly in, or loaded a state during the fly in.

## Controller Port Swap
You can now swap which controller port is used to control Spyro. Simply press any button 3 times while plugged into port 2, to make that the active port. 
To swap back to port 1, do the same thing. Press any button 3 times while plugged into port 1, to make that the active port.


# Bug Fixes
- Fixed consistency counter not incrementing denominator upon loading state
- Fixed gems not being given from flight levels after 1 completion of them
